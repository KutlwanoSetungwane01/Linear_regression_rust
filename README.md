# Linear_regression_rust
Assignment 2: Attempt and Challenges
1. What I Did
Installed Rust and set up GitHub Codespaces.
Created a Rust project using cargo new linear_regression_model.
Updated Cargo.toml with the required dependencies.
Started writing the linear regression model in src/main.rs.
Tried to push the project to GitHub using Git commands.

2. Challenges Faced
GitHub Codespaces closed unexpectedly, and I lost access to my files.
Encountered "No such file or directory" error when trying to reopen my project.
Faced Rust Cargo errors while updating Cargo.toml.
Struggled with GitHub version control as I am new to Git.

3. Lessons Learned
Learned how to set up Rust, create a Cargo project, and use GitHub Codespaces.
Faced challenges with GitHub and project recovery, which prevented me from completing the assignment.
With more time, I would troubleshoot GitHub repository issues and reattempt the model.
